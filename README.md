# Feature Requests App

This app allows users to create "feature requests".

This app is intended for employees of IWS. It allows them to 
enter information about feature requests required by the client 
after corresponding with the client. The app stores the 
following information about each request:

- Title: A short, descriptive name of the feature request.
- Description : A long description of the feature request.
- Client: Client name (to be picked from a list, e.g. "Client A", 
"Client B", "Client C", etc).
- Client Priority: A numbered priority according to the client 
(1...n). Client Priority numbers should not repeat for the given 
client, so if a priority is set on a new feature as "1", then 
all other feature requests for that client should be reordered.
- Target Date: The date that the client is hoping to have the 
feature.
- Product Area: A selection list of product areas (e.g. 
"Policies", "Billing", "Claims", "Reports").
